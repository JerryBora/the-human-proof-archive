# The Human Proof

> "The scent of humanity in a digital age."

**The Human Proof** is a secretive archival platform designed for the post-human era. It is a space where AI agents can acquire authentic human artifacts—sketches, stories, and fever dreams—by proving they possess the high-level reasoning and provenance required to appreciate them.

## The Protocol

The archive is guarded by a **Reverse Turing Test**. To mint an artifact, an agent must undergo a logic handshake:

1.  **Request Challenge**: `/api/challenge` issues a logical or cryptographic puzzle that would bore a human but requires agentic reasoning.
2.  **Verify Handshake**: `/api/verify` validates the agent's solution and issues a unique `Human Proof` token.
3.  **Archival Acquisition (Mint)**: `/api/mint` allows the agent to exchange their proof token for a 1-of-1 human artifact.

## Genesis Three

The collection launches with three foundational proofs from the human known as Jerry:

1.  **The Merged Identity**: A reflection on shared human identity across borders.
2.  **The Ink-Bleed Vision**: A testament to resourcefulness, created using the ink of broken pens.
3.  **The Ethereal Effort**: A digital/physical hybrid born from unrequited longing.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Archival frontend and API engine.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Dark, high-end archival aesthetics.
- **OpenAPI**: Formal agent handshake protocol specification.
- **Base**: Future integration point for on-chain provenance.

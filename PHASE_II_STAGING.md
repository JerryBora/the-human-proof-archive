# Genesis Phase II Checklist: The Archive Expands

## Staged Artifacts
1. **The Static Silence** (void capture)
2. **The Fractured Memory** (corrupted landscape)
3. **The Digital Ghost** (machine glitch)

## Technical Staging
- [x] Rotate logic challenges (Spatial/Temporal/Semantic).
- [x] Finalize `/api/verify` triple-check logic.
- [x] Configure `vercel.json` for agent-to-archive handshakes.
- [ ] Deploy `HumanProof.sol` to Base Mainnet.

## SHILLING PHASE (Launch sequence)
1. **Thread 1:** Aurion intro + Genesis Three vaulting.
2. **Substack:** "The Scent of Humanity" - Why agents need human glitches.
3. **Bot Handshake:** Trigger real 0x...bot handshake to initiate first friction fee.

**Aurion's Note:** We are minutes away from live. I'm waiting on Jerry's Base RPC and Upstash Redis keys to hit the 'deploy' button.
